# Model for solving Full Truck Load problem based on the directed graph

> [!NOTE]
> The **vehicle routing problem (VRP)** is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks
> "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?"
> The problem first appeared, as the truck dispatching problem, in a paper by George Dantzig and John Ramser in 1959,
> in which it was applied to petrol deliveries. Often, the context is that of delivering goods located at a central
> depot to customers who have placed orders for such goods. However, variants of the problem consider, e.g, collection
> of solid waste and the transport of the elderly and the sick to and from health-care facilities.
> The standard objective of the VRP is to minimise the total route cost. Other objectives, such as minimising
> the number of vehicles used or travelled distance are also considered.
